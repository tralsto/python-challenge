# python-challenge

#This repository will include all my files for the Module 3 Challenge.

#The PyBank folder includes my financial analysis of the budget_data csv file in the main.py python file. This folder also includes my analysis folder which has the exported txt file from my printed analysis in main.py

# The PyPoll folder includes all of my analysis regarding the election_data csv file within my main.py python file. The analysis includes the txt file which was exported at the end of my code containing the analyzed values.

# This repo also includes the necessary csv files under the Resources folders in each repected separate section.

# I did reference this shared link from slack to help with the output to the txt file https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/file-handling-in-python/


# Thank you!
